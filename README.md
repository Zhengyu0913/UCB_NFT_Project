# UCB_NFT_Project


## Background
The most expensive NFT ever was sold on December 2, 2021, for a total cost of 
$91.8M. NFT is a fast-growing market and we propose to explore market trends 
and user behavior on NFT prices & demand in the coming Web 3.0. 
## Motivation 
Cryptocurrency has become a household name and is an evolving technology 
that will only become more prevalent in digital finance. There is a need to explore
the infrastructure of this technology and assess & predict various aspects of the 
blockchain ecosystem.
## Questions to answer
● What types of NFTs are popular in the market or are becoming increasingly
popular?
● Are there correlations between the different types of NFT buyers and 
sellers, and its impact on NFT prices?
● How is the value of NFT’s measured and predicted using exploratory data 
analysis of market data and social media interactions
